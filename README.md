# FIN-SCOPE

Financial Intelligence, Simulation & Controlled Decision Engine

## 1. Problem

Financial systems generate a constant stream of events — payment failures,
refunds, settlement changes, gateway degradation. Dashboards can say *that*
something changed; they cannot say *why*, *how much it matters financially*,
*what to do about it*, or *whether an intervention actually worked*.

## 2. What FIN-SCOPE does

FIN-SCOPE is a decision-control layer that sits around a financial workflow
and detects anomalies, investigates their likely root cause, estimates
financial impact, simulates candidate interventions, checks any proposed
action against a deterministic policy engine, executes only bounded and
approved actions, and verifies the outcome.

## 3. Core loop

```
FIND -> INVESTIGATE -> ROOT CAUSE -> IMPACT -> SIMULATE -> DECIDE -> POLICY -> ACT -> VERIFY -> LEARN
```

None of these stages are implemented yet. This repository currently
implements the foundation and the deterministic event-ingestion layer
(FIND itself -- anomaly detection -- has not started) described in
section 12.

## 4. Why AI is used

Claude is used where ambiguity and reasoning exist: hypothesis generation,
evidence interpretation, root-cause ranking, incident summarization, and
proposing bounded interventions with rationale. This begins in the
Investigation phase (not yet implemented).

## 5. Where AI is deliberately avoided

Claude is never used for financial arithmetic, anomaly thresholds, policy
enforcement, authorization, idempotency, execution, or audit logging. Those
are deterministic by design, and AI has no path to directly executing a
financial action — every AI output passes through schema validation and a
deterministic policy engine before anything can be executed.

```

Phase 1 establishes the backend/frontend skeleton, the database (`merchants`,
`audit_log`), API-key auth, and health checks that everything above will be
built on. Phase 2 adds the `financial_events` table and the ingestion/
retrieval API that will feed the Event Engine and, later, FIND -- FIND's
actual detection logic has not been built yet.

## 7. Technology stack

- Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic
- Database: PostgreSQL (local Docker for development; Neon later)
- Cache/queue: Redis (local Docker for development; managed Redis later)
- AI: Anthropic Claude (not yet integrated)
- Payments: Razorpay Test Mode (not yet integrated)

## 8. Sandbox

Not yet implemented. Will provide a controlled synthetic event generator and
incident injector used as the primary benchmark/stress-test environment.

## 9. Razorpay integration

Not yet implemented. `.env.example` reserves `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`,
`RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, and `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for the adapter that
will be built in its designated phase.

## 10. Evaluation methodology

Not yet implemented. Will compare FIN-SCOPE's output against golden answers
for a benchmark set of synthetic scenarios.

## 11. Metrics

Not yet implemented.

### Phase 1 — Foundation

Goal: a working, professionally structured project skeleton with no business
logic yet (no detection, AI, simulation, or execution).

Delivered:
- FastAPI backend (`apps/api`) with config, DB session, Redis client,
  API-key auth dependency, `/health`, and a protected `/v1/ping`
- `merchants` and `audit_log` tables with an Alembic migration
- Next.js frontend (`apps/web`) with a page that displays live backend health
- `infra/docker-compose.yml` for local Postgres + Redis
- pytest suite, ruff and mypy configuration
- `docs/verification/phase-01.md`

Verification: all 18 automated checks in `docs/verification/phase-01.md`
were executed and passed on the project owner's machine (Python 3.13.7,
Node v25.6.1, Docker 28.4.0) -- backend test suite (9 passed), ruff (all
checks passed), mypy (no issues in 12 source files), both Alembic
directions, live health/auth checks against real Postgres/Redis, and the
full frontend build. Two real issues were found and fixed during
verification -- a test-isolation bug in the API-key test fixture, and a
Docker healthcheck race condition in the verification script -- both
documented in `docs/verification/phase-01.md` rather than worked around.

Status: COMPLETE

### Phase 2 — Event Engine (Financial Event Ingestion)

Goal: the deterministic domain layer that later phases (FIND, Investigation,
Simulation, ...) read from -- merchants and financial events, with a
controlled vocabulary, idempotent ingestion, merchant-existence enforcement,
retrieval/filtering, and an append-only audit trail. Per the project's
vertical-slice development principle, this phase also adds the minimum
functional frontend surface needed to exercise it end to end -- not the
final Product UI, which remains Phase 11. Still no anomaly detection, AI,
simulation, or Razorpay integration.

Delivered:
- `financial_events` table (Alembic `0002`), FK to `merchants`, unique
  `(source, external_reference)` for idempotency
- `POST/GET /v1/merchants`, `GET /v1/merchants/{id}`;
  `POST/GET /v1/events`, `GET /v1/events/{id}` (all API-key protected)
- Domain layer (`app/domain/`) separate from routers and schemas;
  event-type vocabulary validated in code, not a Postgres enum
- Every successful ingestion writes an `audit_log` row
- `apps/web/merchants`, `apps/web/events`, `apps/web/events/[id]`: minimal
  functional UI (create/list/filter/detail, loading/empty/error states)
  calling the real API through server-side Next.js Route Handlers, so the
  shared API key never reaches the browser
- CORS is now environment-driven: local dev ports allowed in development,
  nothing allowed by default outside it
- `docs/verification/phase-02.md`

Verification: all 29 automated checks in `docs/verification/phase-02.md`
were executed and passed on the project owner's machine -- backend test
suite (28 passed), ruff (all checks passed), mypy (no issues in 21 source
files), both Alembic directions, live CRUD/auth/idempotency/CORS checks
against real Postgres/Redis, frontend lint and production build, and the
full manual end-to-end flow through the browser. Four real issues were
found during development and verification -- an untracked `.env.local.example`
caused by an over-broad `.gitignore` pattern, a `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
lint violation fixed with a proper Effect/event-handler restructuring, a
backend `.env` path-resolution bug that was the actual root cause of a
frontend 401, and one false failure correctly traced to a stale local
process rather than a code defect -- all documented in
`docs/verification/phase-02.md` rather than worked around.

Status: COMPLETE

## 13. Phase completion status

Phases 1 and 2 are COMPLETE (implemented, verified, documented). No later
phase has any implementation yet.

## 14. Verification results

See `docs/verification/phase-01.md` and `docs/verification/phase-02.md` for
the full checklists, exact commands, and the issues found and fixed during
each phase's verification.

Phase 1 summary: 9/9 backend tests passed, ruff clean, mypy clean, both
Alembic directions verified, live DB/Redis health and API-key auth checks
all passed, full frontend build succeeded.

Phase 2 summary: 28/28 backend tests passed, ruff clean, mypy clean, both
Alembic directions verified, live merchant/event CRUD, auth, idempotency,
and CORS checks all passed against real Postgres/Redis, frontend lint and
production build both succeeded, full manual end-to-end flow confirmed
through the browser.

## 15. Local setup

Requires Python 3.11+, Node 20+, and Docker.

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in API_KEY at minimum; DB/Redis defaults match docker-compose

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r apps/api/requirements.txt -r apps/api/requirements-dev.txt

docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
cd apps/api
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# in another terminal
cd apps/web
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # set API_KEY to match the backend's
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` for backend health,
`http://localhost:3000/merchants` to create/list merchants, and
`http://localhost:3000/events` to ingest and inspect financial events.

Or run `bash scripts/verify-phase-1.sh` / `bash scripts/verify-phase-2.sh` to
do all of the above plus each phase's full verification suite in one pass.

## 16. Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the complete list and comments. `API_KEY` is required
by the backend at startup; `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` default to the
local docker-compose services. `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is only read outside
development (in development, `localhost:3000`/`:3001` are always allowed).
Razorpay and Anthropic keys are reserved for later phases and are optional
until then. `.env` is never committed.

The frontend reads two kinds of variables from `apps/web/.env.local`
(see `apps/web/.env.local.example`): `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, used
client-side only by the public `/health` page, and `API_BASE_URL`/`API_KEY`,
read only by server-side Next.js Route Handlers so the shared API key never
reaches the browser. `.env.local` is never committed.

## 17. Testing

Backend: `pytest` (unit tests for config/auth, integration tests for
`/health` against real and simulated-failure Postgres/Redis, and for the
merchant/event API -- creation, listing, filtering, 404s, auth, invalid
input, and idempotent replay). Frontend: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`,
`npm run build`.

## 18. Known limitations

- No anomaly detection or later-stage business logic exists yet — FIND
  through LEARN are all future phases. Phase 2 only ingests and retrieves
  financial events; nothing reads or analyzes them yet.
- The API-key auth model is intentionally minimal (single shared key); it is
  not a substitute for real multi-tenant auth if that becomes necessary.
- The event-type vocabulary is a fixed set in code, duplicated as a constant
  on the frontend rather than served from an endpoint; fine at this scale.
- Phases 1 and 2's automated verification (installs, tests, docker compose,
  builds) were authored and written from an environment without
  package-registry or Docker access, and were executed by the project owner
  locally — see `docs/verification/phase-01.md` and
  `docs/verification/phase-02.md` for exactly what ran, where, and the
  issues that were found and fixed in each phase.

## 19. Future architecture

See the approved Phase 0 architecture review (development conversation) for
the full target architecture, database schema, evaluation design, and
Razorpay integration plan across all 14 phases.
